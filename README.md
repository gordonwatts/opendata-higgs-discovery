# pyhep-2021-SX-OpenDataDemo
 Talk and practice notebooks for the PyHEP 2021 Proposed Talk

## Using

Setup your environment:

1. This has been run under python 3.9.5
1. `python -m venv .venv`
1. activate your environment (windows: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`)
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

From there you can run jupyter-lab.

Note: This will not run on `binder` as the ServiceX infrastructure uses ports other than 80 to move data around.

## Repo Layout

* the `notebooks` directory contains notebooks that the talk is drawn from. Think of them as stand-alone demonstrations.
